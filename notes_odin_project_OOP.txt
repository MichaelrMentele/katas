classes and methods
	1. What is an implicit return?
		Ruby will return the last line of a definition if a return is not specified.
	2. What is a class?
		A class is a way to organize like things and allow children to inherit functionality. They are a way of collecting behavior together and organizing them by class.
	3. When should you use a class?
		A class is useful when you have a collection of like things that share certain basic functions but perhaps have other specific functions.
	4. How do you create a class?
		class Class_name
			class stuff...
		end
	5. What is a class instance?
		You can create an actual object using the class like a function. It is a cookie cut from the class mold.
	6. CamelCase vs. snake_case
	7. Instantiating a class by:
		variable = Class_name.new
	8. You can set the state of an instance by:
		- passing arguments 
		- changing initializations
	9. The initialize method should:
		- Allow you to set your state
		- initialize variables
	10. A class method is:
		Used on a class while a instance method is used on an instance.
	11. #count and #sort are instance methods because:
		They are used on instances. When you creat an array you are implicitly creating an instance of the array class.
	12. Declaring Instance vs Class methods:
